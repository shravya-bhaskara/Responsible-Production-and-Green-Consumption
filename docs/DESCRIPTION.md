# Responsible Production and Green Consumption


### What's the problem?
A fisherman gets hold of more plastic or garbage found at rivers or seas than any other organisation or committee. And so most of it is just found lying around until someone takes up the initiative. This could cause a time lapse and might result in further danger to aqua life as well as increase in water related diseases due to increased water pollution. Inorder to help with that, improve the water quality and reduce the affect on marine life, we have devised a system that would help the committee and societ at great. The fishermen themselves will be able to notify the authorities regarding the amount of pplastic or garbade dump.

### How can technology help?
We can devise a system that connects the fishermen with the local authorities. The fishermen will have to send an SMS or a photo from their mobile phones, the local authorities upon receiving it, will sen in a team to collect all the garbage dump and will also notify higher authorities regarding the same so that the recycling can also be done effectively.

### The idea
This project aims to establish a connection between the fishermen and the civic authorities regarding the plastic dump found at the banks of rivers/ lakes. We have made use of Node RED in doing so.

### Features:
* Enable the fishermen to communicate and inform the local authorities about the amount of plastic or the garbage dump found at the rivers. They can do so by simply sending an SMS or a photo of their surrounding. 
* The local authorities can send in a team to collect all the plastic dump and inform higher authorities regarding the same. 
* The system makes use of Node RED feature. The fisherman shall send in an SMS or a photo and will be received with a small acknowledgement about whether if it was received or not. 

### Tackling the problem:
Our aim was to create a service using all the IBM services provided so that proper communication could be ensured. However we weren't familiar with IBM cloud so completed doing the Node RED part and will work on the Twilio followed by the Processing part which includes image capture recognition and feedback SMS. 

### What did we accomplish in Node RED?
